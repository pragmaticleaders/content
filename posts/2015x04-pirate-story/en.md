Receintly I've been looking for some music animations for my little dauther and discovered [Eric Herman](http://www.erichermanmusic.com/about.html) and his briliant and edifying pirate story.

This kind of conflicts actually happens pretty often in real life.  Different teams, different businesses, different industries -- same 3 factors.

Factor 1 --- No Criteria
------------------------

Pirates made almost classical mistake -- jumping directly to what and ommiting why.  Why to paint the ship in the first place!  If we don't know why, we don't have criteria to select good solution.  Then alternative solutions people come up with -- something we shoud benefit from -- actually becomes an issue per se.  Smart people can always prove the superiority of their idea.  Few such superior ideas in the team are the perfect firewood for conflict.

{:.well}
First, align the goal.  Then specify success criteria.  Only then discuss the solutions.

Facing such conflict leader is tempted to select one of the obvious strategies.

{:.indend}
### Above the conflict

{:.indend}
Leader acts as a moderator, not interfering the conflict and letting people settle themselves.  Works if all your team members are in essence leaders.  Otherwise this may become a neverending story.  People may interpret this as weaknes, inability to make a decision -- that is the responsibility of a leader.

{:.indend}
### Compromise

{:.indend}
Leader combines all solutions into one compromise.  Works by making everybody equily unhappy.  Almost always this is least optimal solution.

{:.indend}
### Decision by Authority

{:.indend}
Leader makes a decision himself and uses his authority to force it.  Quick solution that may be used in crisis situations if communicated properly.  Otherwise kills proactivity and engagemant.  In worst case leader may get an oposition inside a team.

Instead leader can use the following technique.

{:.well}
Stop any discussions.  Return to why and align the goal.  Choose the criteria.  Evaluate options.  Repeat with harder criteria until only one option is left. 

But lets return to our pirates.  Actually the outcome wouldn't be so disastrous if the ground hadn't be prepared.

Factor 2 --- No Vision
----------------------
  
> So Bluebeard said, "Since we've nothing to do"

Pirates had nothing to do.  Actually I don't think they really had nothing to do.  You know, there are plenty of things to do when you are a pirate.  What they rather lacked was the vision of future, the understanding where were they going.  And without the vision people don't know what to do and what are the priorities.  Thus they will work on tasks of their own preferences.  This makes it quite difficult to align the goal.

{:.well}
Have a vision.  Communicate it to your team.

Still even in these circumstances a good team may at least avoid conflicts.  Unless it is already demoralized.

Factor 3 --- No Wins
--------------------
  
> Seaward they scudded and skipped on the breeze  
> But couldn't find treasure to plunder and seize  

Pirates team was not succesful for some long time.  And people need a story of success to relate to.  Without it the morale and engagement go down and people start to question their team membership.  After all nobody realy wants to have a part in failure.  

{:.well}
Plan your wins.  Then celebrate them.  

Normally you plan to have most important things done first.  But what if that important thing is too difficult?  Sometimes it makes sence to start from less important but esier part, so that team can accomplish it and get a its taste of victory.

And remeber -- a pirate without treasure is like a monkey without a spatula!
